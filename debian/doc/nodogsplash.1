The following describes what Nodogsplash does, how to get it and run it, and
how to customize its behavior for your application.
.sp
Contents:
.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
Nodogsplash (NDS) offers a solution to this problem: You want to provide controlled
and reasonably secure public access to an internet connection; and while you
want to require users to give some acknowledgment of the service you are
providing, you don\(aqt need or want the complexity of user account names and
passwords and maintaining a separate database\-backed authentication server.
When installed and running, Nodogsplash implements a simple \(aqauthentication\(aq
protocol. First, it detects any user attempting to use your internet connection
to request a web page. It captures the request, and instead serves back a
\(aqsplash\(aq web page using its own builtin web server. The splash page contains a
link which, when the user clicks on it, opens limited access for them to the
internet via your connection, beginning by being redirected to their originally
requested page. This access expires after a certain time interval.
Nodogsplash also permits limiting the aggregate bandwidth provided to users, if
you don\(aqt want to grant all of your available upload or download bandwidth.
Specific features of Nodogsplash are configurable, by editing the configuration
file and the splash page. The default installed configuration may be all you
need, though.
.sp
Nodogsplash supports multiple means of authentication:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2

.SH INSTALLING NODOGSPLASH
.SS OpenWrt
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Have a router working with OpenWrt. At the time of writing, Nodogsplash has been tested with OpenWrt 18.06.0;
it may or may not work on older versions of OpenWrt or on other kinds of Linux\-based router firmware.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure your router is basically working before you try to install
Nodogsplash. In particular, make sure your DHCP daemon is serving addresses on the interface that nodogsplash will manage.
The default is br\-lan but can be changed to any interface by editing the /etc/config/nodogsplash file.
.IP \(bu 2
To install Nodogsplash, you may use the OpenWrt Luci web interface or alternatively, ssh to your router and run the command:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBopkg update\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
followed by
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBopkg install nodogsplash\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Nodogsplash is enabled by default and will start automatically on reboot or can be started and stopped manually.
.IP \(bu 2
If the interface that you want Nodogsplash to manage is not br\-lan,
edit /etc/config/nodogsplash and set GatewayInterface.
.IP \(bu 2
To start Nodogsplash, run the following, or just reboot the router:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB/etc/init.d/nodogsplash start\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
To test the installation, connect a client device to the interface on your
router that is managed by Nodogsplash (for example, connect to the router\(aqs
wireless lan).
Most client device operating systems and browsers support Captive Portal Detection (CPD) and the operating system or browser on that device will attempt to contact a pre defined port 80 web page.
CPD will trigger Nodogsplash to serve the default splash page where you can click or tap Continue to access the Internet.
.sp
See the Authentication section for details of setting up a proper authentication process.
.sp
If your client device does not display the splash page it most likely does not support CPD. You should then manually trigger Nodogsplash by trying to access a port 80 web site (for example, google.com:80 is a good choice).

.SH FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
.SS What\(aqs the difference between v0.9, v1, v2 and v3?
.sp
v0.9 and v1 are the same codebase with the same feature set.
If the documentation says something about v1, this is usally also valid
for v0.9.
.sp
v2 was developed while version v1 wasn\(aqt released. In v2 the http code got replaced by libmicrohttpd
as well the template engine got rewritten. Many feature were defunct because of this procedure.
.sp
v3 cleans up the source code and adds the binauth feature to be able to call an external script
for authentication. This is similar to the old binvoucher feature, but more flexible.
The ClientTimeout setting was split into PreauthIdleTimeout and AuthIdleTimeout and
for the ClientForceTimeout setting SessionTimeout is now used instead.
.SS Can I update from v0.9 to v1
.sp
This is a very smooth update with full compatibility.
.SS Can I update from v0.9/v1 to v2.0.0

.SS I would like to use QoS or TrafficControl on OpenWrt
.sp
The original pre version 1 feature has been broken since OpenWrt 12.09 (Attitude Adjustment), because
OpenWrt removed the IMQ (Intermediate queueing device) support. We\(aqre looking for somebody who to fix this!
.sp
However the OpenWrt package, SQM Scripts, is fully compatible with Nodogsplash and if configured to operate on the Nodogsplash interface (br\-lan by default) will provide efficient IP connection based traffic control to ensure fair usage of available bandwidth.
.SS Is \fI\%https://\fP redirection supported?
.sp
No. We believe this is the wrong way to do it, because all connections would have a critical certificate failure.
HTTPS web sites are now more or less a standard and to maintain security and user confidence it is essential that captive portals DO NOT attempt to capture port 443.
.sp
Captive Portal Detection (CPD) has evolved as an enhancement to the network manager component included with major Operating Systems (Linux, Android, iOS/macOS, Windows). Using a pre defined port 80 web page (depending on the vendor) the network manager will detect the presence of a captive portal hotspot and notify the user. In addition, most major browsers now support CPD.
.SH HOW NODOGSPLASH (NDS) WORKS
.sp
A wireless router running OpenWrt has two or more interfaces; NDS
manages one of them. This will typically be br\-lan, the bridge to both the
wireless and wired LAN; or could be for example wlan0 if you wanted NDS
to work just on the wireless interface.
.SS A simplified summary of operation is as follows:
.sp
By default, NDS blocks everything, but intercepts port 80 requests.
.sp
An initial port 80 request will be generated on a client device, either by the user
manually browsing to an http web page, or automatically by the client device\(aqs
built in Captive Portal Detection (CPD).
.sp
As soon as this initial port 80 request is received, NDS will redirect the client to either
its own splash page, or a splash page on a configured Forwarding Authentication Service (FAS).
.sp
The user of the client device will then be expected to complete some actions
on the splash page, such as accepting terms of service, entering a username and password
etc. (this will of course be on either the basic NDS splash.html or the page presented
by the FAS, depending on the NDS configuration).
.sp
Once the user on the client device has sucessfully completed the splash page
actions, the page then links directly, with a query string, to an NDS virtual http directory
provided by NDS\(aqs built in web server.
.sp
For security, NDS expects to receive the same valid token it allocated when
the client issued its initial port 80 request. If the token received is valid,
NDS then "authenticates" the client device, allowing access to the Internet.
.sp
However if Binauth is enabled, NDS first calls the Binauth script, passing if required a username and password to that script.
If the binauth script returns positively (ie return code 0), NDS then "authenticates" the
client device, allowing access to the Internet.
.sp
In FAS secure mode, it is the responsibility of the FAS to obtain the client token in a secure manner from NDS.
.sp
When FAS is disabled, the token is supplied to the basic splash.html page served by NDS
and passed back in clear text in the query string along with any username and password required for Binauth.
.sp
FAS and Binauth can be enabled together.
This can give great flexibility with FAS providing authentication
and Binauth providing post authentication processing closely linked to NDS.
.SS Packet filtering
.sp
Nodogsplash considers four kinds of packets coming into the router over the
managed interface. Each packet is one of these kinds:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Blocked, if the MAC mechanism is block, and the source MAC address of the
packet matches one listed in the BlockedMACList; or if the MAC mechanism
is allow, and source MAC address of the packet does not match one listed
in the AllowedMACList or the TrustedMACList. These packets are dropped.
.IP 2. 3
Trusted, if the source MAC address of the packet matches one listed in the
TrustedMACList. By default, these packets are accepted and routed to all
destination addresses and ports. If desired, this behavior can be
customized by FirewallRuleSet trusted\-users and FirewallRuleSet trusted\-
users\-to\-router lists in the nodogsplash.conf configuration file, or by
the EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted\-users EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted\-users\-to\-
router directives.
.IP 3. 3
Authenticated, if the packet\(aqs IP and MAC source addresses have gone
through the nodogsplash authentication process and has not yet expired.
These packets are accepted and routed to a limited set of addresses and
ports (see FirewallRuleSet authenticated\-users and FirewallRuleSet users\-
to\-router in the nodogsplash.conf configuration file).
.IP 4. 3
Preauthenticated. Any other packet. These packets are accepted and routed
to a limited set of addresses and ports (see FirewallRuleSet
preauthenticated\-users and FirewallRuleSet users\-to\-router in the
nodogsplash.conf configuration file). Any other packet is dropped, except
that a packet for destination port 80 at any address is redirected to port
2050 on the router, where nodogsplash\(aqs builtin libhttpd\-based web server
is listening. This begins the \(aqauthentication\(aq process. The server will
serve a splash page back to the source IP address of the packet. The user
clicking the appropriate link on the splash page will complete the
process, causing future packets from this IP/MAC address to be marked as
Authenticated until the inactive or forced timeout is reached, and its
packets revert to being Preauthenticated.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Nodogsplash implements these actions by inserting rules in the router\(aqs
iptables mangle PREROUTING chain to mark packets, and by inserting rules in the
nat PREROUTING, filter INPUT and filter FORWARD chains which match on those
marks. Because it inserts its rules at the beginning of existing chains,
nodogsplash should be insensitive to most typical existing firewall
configurations.
.SS Traffic control
.sp
Data rate control on an IP connection basis can be achived using SQM scripts
configured separately, with NDS being fully compatible.
.sp
It should be noted that while setup options and binauth do accept traffic/quota settings,
these values currently have no effect and are reserved for future development.
.SH FORWARDING AUTHENTICATION SERVICE (FAS)
.SS Overview
.sp
Nodogsplash (NDS) supports external (to NDS) authentication service via simple configuration options.
.sp
These options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
1. fasport. This enables Forwarding Authentication Service (FAS).
Redirection is changed from splash.html to a FAS.
The value is the IP port number of the FAS

2. fasremoteip. If set, this is the remote ip address of the FAS,
if not set it will take the value of the NDS gateway address.

3. faspath. This is the path to the login page on the FAS.

4. fas secure enable. If set to "1", authaction and the client
token are not revealed and it is the responsibility of the FAS
to request the token from NDSCTL. If set to "0", the client
token is sent to the FAS in clear text in the query string
of the redirect along with authaction and redir.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using FAS
.sp
When FAS is enabled, NDS automatically configures access to the FAS service.
.sp
The FAS service must serve an http splash of its own to replace the NDS splash.html.
Typically, the FAS service will be written in PHP or any other language that can provide dynamic web content.
.sp
FAS can then provide an action form for the client, typically requesting login, or self account creation for login.
.sp
The FAS can be on the same device as NDS, on the same local area network as NDS, or on an Internet hosted web server.
.sp
If FAS Secure is enabled, NDS will supply only the gateway name, the client IP address and the originally requested URL.
.sp
It is the responsibility of FAS to obtain the unique client token allocated by NDS.
.sp
If the client successfully authenticates in the FAS, FAS will return the unique token to NDS to finally allow the client access to the Internet.
.sp
If FAS Secure is disabled, the token is sent to FAS as clear text.
.sp
A FAS on the local network can obtain the user token by requesting it from NDS, using, for example SSH.
.sp
A Secure Internet based FAS is best implemented as a two stage process, first using a local FAS, that in turn accesses an https remote FAS using tools such as curl or wget.
.SS Running FAS on your Nodogsplash router
.sp
A FAS service will run quite well on uhttpd (the web server that serves Luci) on an OpenWrt supported device with 8MB flash and 32MB ram but shortage of ram may well be an issue if more than two or three clients log in at the same time. For this reason a device with a minimum of 8MB flash and 64MB ram is recommended.
.sp
Running on uhttpd with PHP:
Install the modules php7 and php7\-cgi on LEDE for a simple example. Further modules may be required depending on your requirements.
.sp
To enable php in uhttpd you must add the line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
list interpreter ".php=/usr/bin/php\-cgi"
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to the /etc/config/uhttpd file in the config uhttpd \(aqmain\(aq or first section.
.sp
The two important NDS options to set will be:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
1. fasport. By default this will be port 80 for uhttpd

2. faspath. Set to, for example, /myfas/fas.php,

In the configuration file, a FirewallRule has the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBFirewallRule permission [protocol [port portrange] [to ip]\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIpermission\fP is required and must be allow, block, drop, log, or ulog.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIprotocol\fP is optional. If present, it must be tcp, udp, icmp, or all.
Defaults to all.
.IP \(bu 2
port \fIportrange\fP is optional. If present, protocol must be tcp or udp.
portrange can be a single integer port number, or a colon\-separated port
range, e.g. 1024:1028. Defaults to all ports.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIto ip\fP is optional. If present, ip must be a decimal dotted\-quad IP address
with optional mask. Defaults to 0.0.0.0/0, i.e. all addresses.
.IP \(bu 2
To change the contents of the splash page, edit the splash page file:
.sp
\fB/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/splash.html\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
When the splash page is served, the following variables in the page are
replaced by their values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$gatewayname\fP The value of GatewayName as set in nodogsplash.conf.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$authtarget\fP A URL which encodes a unique token and the URL of the user\(aqs
original web request. If nodogsplash receives a request at this URL, it
completes the authentication process for the client and replies to the
request with a "302 Found" to the encoded originally requested
URL. (Alternatively, you can use a GET\-method HTML form to send this
information to the nodogsplash server; see below.) As a simple example:
.sp
\fB<a href="$authtarget">Enter</a>\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$imagesdir\fP The directory in nodogsplash\(aqs web hierarchy where images to be
displayed in the splash page must be located.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$tok\fP,*$redir*,*$authaction*, and \fI$denyaction\fP are also available and can be
useful if you want to write the splash page to use a GET\-method HTML form
instead of using $authtarget as the value of an href attribute to
communicate with the nodogsplash server. As a simple example:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<form method=\(aqGET\(aq action=\(aq$authaction\(aq>
  <input type=\(aqhidden\(aq name=\(aqtok\(aq value=\(aq$tok\(aq>
  <input type=\(aqhidden\(aq name=\(aqredir\(aq value=\(aq$redir\(aq>
  <input type=\(aqsubmit\(aq value=\(aqClick Here to Enter\(aq>
</form>

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$clientip\fP, \fI$clientmac\fP and \fI$gatewaymac\fP The respective addresses
of the client or gateway. This might be usefull in cases where the data
needs to be forwarded to some other place by the plash page itself.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$nclients\fP and \fI$maxclients\fP User stats. Usefull when you need to
display something like "n of m users online" on the splash site.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI$uptime\fP The time Nodogsplash is running.
.IP \(bu 2
A list of all available variables are included in the splash.html file.
.IP \(bu 2
If the user accesses the splash page while being authenticated, a status page is shown:
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/status.html\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the status.html file, the same variables as in the splash.html site can be used.
.SH DEBUGGING NODOGSPLASH
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To see maximally verbose debugging output from nodogsplash, edit the
/etc/init.d/nodogsplash file to set the OPTIONS variable to the flags "\-s \-d 7",
restart or reboot, and view messages with logread. The \-s flag logs to
syslog; the \-d 7 flag sets level 7, LOG_DEBUG, for debugging messages
(see syslog.h). You don\(aqt want to run with these flags routinely, as it will
quickly fill the syslog circular buffer, unless you enable remote logging. A
lower level of logging, for example level 5, LOG_NOTICE, is more appropriate
for routine use (this is the default). Logging level can also be set using
ndsctl as shown above.
Alternatively, you can set the flag \-f instead of \-s, and restart.
This will run nodogsplash in the foreground, logging to stdout.
.IP \(bu 2
When stopped, nodogsplash deletes its iptables rules, attempting to leave the
router\(aqs firewall in its original state. If not (for example, if nodogsplash
crashes instead of exiting cleanly) subsequently starting and stopping
nodogsplash should remove its rules.
.IP \(bu 2
Nodogsplash operates by marking packets (and, if traffic control is enabled,
passing packets through intermediate queueing devices). Most QOS packages
will also mark packets and use IMQ\(aqs. Therefore one or both of Nodogsplash and
a QOS package may malfunction if used together. Potential conflicts may be
investigated by looking at your overall iptables setup. To check to see all
the rules in, for example, the mangle table chains, run
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBiptables \-t mangle \-v \-n \-L\fP
.UNINDENT

Not all features are finished or working as properly as they should.
Here is a list of things that need to be improved:

.IP \(bu 2
While (un\-) block/trust/allow via the ndsctl tool take effect, the state object of the client in NDS is not affected.
Both systems still need to be connected (in src/auth.c).
