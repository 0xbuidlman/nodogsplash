Content:
	Nodogsplash (NDS), by default, serves this splash page (splash.html)
	when a client device Captive Portal Detection (CPD) process
	attempts to send a port 80 request to the Internet.

	You may either embed css in this file or use a separate .css file
	in the same directory as this file, as demonstrated here.

	It should be noted when designing a custom splash page
	that for security reasons many CPD implementations:
		Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
		Prohibit the use of href links.
		Prohibit downloading of external files
			(including .css and .js).
		Prohibit the execution of javascript.

	Also, note that any images you reference should reside in the
	subdirectory that is defined by $imagesdir (default: "images").

Authentication:
	A client is authenticated on submitting an HTTP form, method=get,
	passing $authaction, $tok and $redir.

	It is also possible to authenticate using an href link to
	$authtarget but be aware that many device Captive Portal Detection
	processes prohibit href links, so this method may not work with
	all client devices.

Available variables:
	error_msg: $error_msg
	gatewayname: $gatewayname
	tok: $tok
	redir: $redir
	authaction: $authaction
	denyaction: $denyaction
	authtarget: $authtarget
	clientip: $clientip
	clientmac: $clientmac
	gatewaymac: $gatewaymac
	nclients: $nclients
	maxclients: $maxclients
	uptime: $uptime
	imagesdir: $imagesdir
	pagesdir: $pagesdir
	clientupload: $clientupload
	clientdownload: $clientdownload

Additional Variables that can be passed back via the HTTP get,
or appended to the query string of the authtarget link:
	username
	password
